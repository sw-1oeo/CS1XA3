Personal CV webpage:

https://templateflip.com/templates/creative-cv/
Utilized the template from the link above as a template to build my own web page, using html and CSS.


Simple Web app:

Used Javascript and its library, jQuery, as well as html and CSS to build a simple game web app “catch the mosquitos”.
How to play:
User has to click start button to initiate the game, and then for 16sec, 7 mosquitos in the room will be moving randomly with a different time interval.
What user has to do is just to click each mosquito to catch it, and then it will disappear from the screen, and as a result of that the user will get one score up.
When the time is up, If the user successfully catch all 7 mosquitos, he/she will get “You killed all the mosquitos. Now you can sleep!” Message. If not, he/she will get “Still # mosquitos are left in the room. You want to try again?” Message. Upon clicking cancel button, the page is reloaded so that user can retry.
