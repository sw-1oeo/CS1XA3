feature 5.1: script input

Once the script is executed, it first shows options of features.
As the user input their option of number, this input is stored to variable named jin.
If statements are used here, so, for example, if the user inputted 1, variable jin is matched with 1, so by the if statement, it will work on the feature 5.2 which is to create a TODO log using grep.   

I left other features (from 2 to 6) for project1-part2 for now.
